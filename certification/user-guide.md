# Tiny Trainable Instruments - User Guide

## Materials

Participants of the study will will get these 6 minimum materials for building your Tiny Trainable Instruments:

1. 1x Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller with headers
2. 1x Micro USB Cable
3. 1x Solderless breadboard
4. 1x Pack of jumper wires
5. 1x Micro servo motor
6. 1x Piezo buzzer

## Assembly

During the workshop, we will place the Arduino microcontroller on the solderless breadboard, to make all the connections in a safe and easy way.
