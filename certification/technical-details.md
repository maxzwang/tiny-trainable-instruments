# Tiny Trainable Instruments - Technical details

Each instrument is comprised out of off-the-shelf components, with an Arduino microcontroller chip being placed on a solderless breadboard, and connected with Dupont jumper wires to different low-voltage components for multimedia output, in particular a piezo buzzer for sound, and a micro servo motor for movement.

These are typical off-the-shelf and commercially available materials used on introduction to physical computing classes for adults and children.

There is no unconventional wiring, everything will be powered with a micro USB cable which provdes a low voltage and surge protected power supply from your computer.
