# Tiny Trainable Instruments - Information for participants

Each instrument is comprised out of off-the-shelf components, with an Arduino microcontroller chip being placed on a solderless breadboard, and connected with Dupont jumper wires to different low-voltage components for multimedia output, in particular LEDs for lights, piezo buzzers for sound, and micro servo motors for movement. 

These are typical off-the-shelf and commercially available materials used on introduction to physical computing classes.

There is no unconventional wiring, everything will be powered with a micro USB cable which provdes
